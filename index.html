  On PT1, a test email was sent on the Thunderbird email client. 
  On PC1, the received message was then inspected by viewing its email header.

  <ul>
    <li>Return Path: This was the original sender address, as expected. No relaying servers changed the address.</li>
    <li>Received: In this network there were just two servers that processed the emails, mail.515support.com (receiving server) and mail.515web.net (sending server). </li>
    <li>From: This is the original sender's address as expected.</li>
  </ul>

<div class="row fw-bold p-0 m-0 mb-3">Phishing Email Analysis</div>
<div class="row m-0 p-0">
  PT1 has Postfix installed to allow it to act as an open mail relay SMTP server.
  This type of server can be used by spammers to send phishing emails to potential victims.
  The server was started with the following code:
  <code>service postfix start</code>
  In the settings for hostmaster@515web.net, the option to edit the SMTP server (mail.515web.net) can be found.
  <div class="row mb-5 justify-content-center"><img src="images/4.png" alt="4" class="col-lg-6"></div>
  Make sure the default SMTP port is entered and no security and authentication is set.
  <div class="row mb-5"><img src="images/5.png" alt="5" class="col-lg-6"><img src="images/6.png" alt="6" class="col-lg-6"></div>
  A phishing email was sent to sam@515support.com with malware attached. 
  <div class="row mb-5 justify-content-center"><img src="images/7.png" alt="7" class="col-lg-6"></div>
  <ul>
    <li>Return-Path/From: The sender address domain is familiar looking so will likely be be trusted by the potential victim.</li>
    <li>Received: The open relay server can be seen in the list.</li>
  </ul>
  Normally authorized relay servers would be managed by Sender Policy Framework (SPF), Domainkey Identified Mail (DKIM), 
  and Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance (DMARC).
  If this server domain wasn't whitelisted it should be investigated as a possible threat.
  <div class="row mb-5 justify-content-center"><img src="images/8.png" alt="8" class="col-lg-6"></div>
</div>

<div class="row fw-bold p-0 m-0 mb-3">Impersonate an Associate</div>
<div class="row m-0 p-0">
  In the hostmaster account settings on PT1, an associate name familiar to the target victim was used in a email address.
  <div class="row mb-5 justify-content-center"><img src="images/9.png" alt="9" class="col-lg-6"></div>
  A phishing email with the malware attached was sent to PC1 to impersonate as the proposed associate.
  <div class="row mb-5 justify-content-center"><img src="images/10.png" alt="10" class="col-lg-6"></div>
  When checking PC1, the email was not received however.
</div>

<div class="row fw-bold p-0 m-0 mb-3">SMTP Log Analysis</div>
<div class="row m-0 p-0">
  On MS1, hMailServer Administrator was used to check the SMTP logs for what happened to the missing email.
  <div class="row mb-5 justify-content-center"><img src="images/11.png" alt="11" class="col-lg-6"></div>
  In the SMTP log where the most recent events are held, 
  there should be a “530 SMTP authentication is required” warning since the local server refused the connection after server reset.
  <div class="row mb-5 justify-content-center"><img src="images/12.png" alt="12" class="col-lg-6"></div>
  Checking the PC1 email account, there should be a nondelivery report (NDR) reflecting the log found on MS1.
  <div class="row mb-5 justify-content-center"><img src="images/13.png" alt="13" class="col-lg-6"></div>
  Further action could be taken in a real world scenario, such as contacting the open relay server owner or blacklisting them and their IP addresses.
